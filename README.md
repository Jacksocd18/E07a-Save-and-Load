# E07a-Save-and-Load    

This is a game that saves a number value and loads it back onto the screen after you change the current value.
This was an opportunity for me to use a simple form of saving and loading a game in Godot.
This game was edited by myself, Christopher Jackson, using resources from the assignment's description.
